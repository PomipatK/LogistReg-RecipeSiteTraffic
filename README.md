# LogistReg-RecipeSiteTraffic
My Datacamp's professional DS Project: 
As a data scientist, I was tasked with addressing a business challenge for a company’s marketing team. They observed that the choice of the recipe featured on the website’s homepage significantly impacts web traffic. However, they lacked a clear method for selecting the optimal recipe to maximize visits.
My responsibility was to develop a predictive model that could forecast which recipe would likely drive higher website traffic. The goal was to provide actionable recommendations to guide future recipe selections and help the marketing team plan more effectively.
